# Portfolio Activity C3M4a — Network Hardening Assessment

## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on providing targeted network hardening recommendations for a social media organization that recently experienced a major data breach. As a security analyst, I was tasked with analyzing the given vulnerabilities and recommending effective mitigation techniques to strengthen the organization’s security posture.

## 🔍 Scenario Summary

After a breach compromised customer data, an internal review uncovered four critical security issues:

- Employees were sharing passwords.
- The admin database password remained the default.
- Firewall rules for traffic filtering were not in place.
- Multifactor authentication (MFA) was not implemented.

The task was to provide remediation strategies for these known weaknesses to prevent future incidents.

## ✅ Recommended Hardening Practices

To strengthen the network, I proposed the following measures:

- **Implement strong password policies and end password sharing.**
- **Replace all default credentials with complex, unique passwords.**
- **Establish firewall rules** to monitor and control network traffic.
- **Deploy MFA** to improve identity verification and limit unauthorized access.

These practices, when implemented consistently and reviewed regularly, offer a robust defense against common network attacks and misconfigurations.
