# Portfolio Activity C3M3 — Network Traffic Analysis

## 🧩 Project Overview

This project involves analyzing DNS and ICMP traffic using data from a network protocol analyzer (tcpdump). You were given a captured log and tasked with identifying the network protocol involved in a cybersecurity incident where users could not access a website.

## 📄 Scenario Summary

You are a cybersecurity analyst supporting IT services for a client. Customers reported that **www.yummyrecipesforme.com** was unreachable, showing a “destination port unreachable” error. You attempted access and received the same error. A tcpdump log was provided, revealing ICMP packets returning an error: **“udp port 53 unreachable.”**

## 🔧 Your Role

As the cybersecurity analyst, your responsibilities included:

- Reviewing the provided tcpdump log
- Identifying relevant protocols (DNS via UDP and ICMP)
- Analyzing error messages and packet behavior
- Completing a cybersecurity incident report based on findings

## 📁 Files Included

- `tcpdump log sample C3M3.png`
- `Cybersecurity-incident-report-network-traffic-analysis.pdf`

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

- Network protocol analysis
- ICMP and DNS troubleshooting
- Incident documentation
- Communication of technical findings
